### Peer Evaluations

* Complete your CATME peer evaluations for `h03`

  * Check your email for an invitation to the CATME peer evaluation
  * Complete it by 11:59pm tonight

## Today

* Do a standup meeting to update the team on progress with team02 (or team01 if not finished.)
  * Please post written update in slack channel first
  * Then when all have posted, do out loud standing standup
* Then: if you haven't done it yet, and *whether finished with team01 or not* do the work to divide up the 6 tasks for team02 as described below.
* There should be a pinned post on your team slack channel by the end of discussion today with the division of the six database tables.
* Then: if you aren't done with team01, *you are behind!*  Get finished, and then start team02.
* Otherwise:
  * As a team, review your team02 Kanban board, and estimate when the team will be finished with team02.
  * Post that estimate in your team slack channel.
  * Then work on team02.

## Read up on the Retrospective Process

# Dividing up the 6 database tables for team02

Divide up the six database tables from team02 among the team members (see [team02]({{page.team02}}) for more details).  I suggest that you do this on your team slack channel in a single post, and then "pin" that post to your channel.

That post might look something like this:

```
Adam:  Articles
Brianna: Menu Item Reviews
Chris:  Help Requests
Danny: Recommendation Requests
Erin: UCSB Organizations
Fay: UCSB Dining Commons Menu Items
```
