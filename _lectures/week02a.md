## Announcements

* If you haven't completed jpa00, you are falling behind; try get it done before tomorrow.
* Try to at least start jpa01 before tomorrow by submitting the starter code.

Tomorrow in discussion
* If ECI setup is done, start webapps 
* Two short assignments (jpa02, jpa03); minimal coding, lots of configuration
* Thursday: important briefing (informed consent) and extra credit opportunity, and time to get help with jpa02, jpa03.
  * If you finish jpa02, jpa03 before class, you'll only have to stay for a short amount of time (20 minutes), and you can leave early on Thursday.
  * It's still important to come for those 20 minutes, though you can do so on zoom if that's better for you.
* Hope to start team activities Tuesday of next week
