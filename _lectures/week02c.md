# First: Informed Consent Briefing

* [Slides]({{page.slides}})
* Short version: 
  - If you fill out the "pre-survey" linked to on Canvas and on the Announcements Channel on Slack, you will get 0.33 points extra credit added to your final grade.
  - You will be asked to give your informed consent to allow us to use your data for research to help improve software engineering education.
  - We hope you will say yes, but you are free to say no.
  - You get the extra credit regardless of your answer.
  - None of the staff will know your answer until after the course is over.
  - We only know whether or not you filled out the survey so that we
    we can give you extra credit.

    
# Rest of class today:

* Today: Work on jpa01, jpa02, jpa03.
* If done, you may leave, but we hope you stay to help others.
* If not done, let your teammates know where you stand.
* The goal is to wrap it all up by Tuesday so we can start the team projects.
* Come in person if you can, though it's not required today.


# Try to finish up all three by this weekend, or by Monday

It is important that everyone on the team try to finish all three of these (jpa01, jpa02, jpa03) before this coming Tuesday's lecture if possible.  Reason: that will give you the needed preparation for the first team exercise.   So that's a target of Tuesday 04/16 4:59pm for all three.

They will all be accepted a little later than that, but that's only 
as a "safety"; we'll expect all students to start on team01 on Tuesday.


# Help your teammates, help the team

It is to the benefit of the entire team to have everyone up to speed.

If you are finished with all three, you are encouraged to let your teammates know, and make yourself available to them to help them finish.  Conversely, if you are not finished with all three, you are encouraged to let your teammates know where you are and to ask for help.

# Get your laptop set up

One other thing: as part of jpa03, everyone needs to have their personal laptop setup for both Java (java and maven) and Javascript (nvm, node).

So, please help one another with that as well.

# Monitor these slack channel always (esp during lecture/discussion)

Every class, whether you come in person or not, please monitor these slack channels during all assigned lecture/lab times:

* `#announcements`
* Your team channel, e.g. `#s24-5pm-1`, `#s24-4pm-2`, etc.  This is where you ask your teammates for help or offer help.
* The help channel of whatever current assignments you aren't finished with e.g. `#help-jpa01`, `#help-jpa02`, `#help-jpa03`
* And use `#help-lecture-discussion` when asking for help from the staff.
