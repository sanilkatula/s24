<!-- # Update on team01 progress

Overall, it appears that 7 of the 12 teams are pretty close to finishing up and submitting team01, so we will start team02 today, which keeps us on schedule.  Note that if the schedule slips, it doesn't impact the staffâ€”it impacts all of you.   The number one piece of feedback that I consistently get on course evaluations is "start the legacy code projects" sooner.    I'm trying to do that.  But I can't do that without your help; you have to stay on schedule as well.

Andrew and I have gone through all 12 teams Kanban boards to give you some individual level team feedback on how you are doing.  Please look at that, and work as a team to address it. -->

# Today:
* Everyone do a standup on team01
* Everyone on the team:
  - If you haven't yet, do a code review for at least one open pull request.
  - Note that the code review needs to be a *proper code review* done *as a code review* on Github.
  - That means using the Code Review workflow, not just a "comment".
  - To understand the difference, see [this article on the course website](https://ucsb-cs156.github.io/topics/code_reviews/code_reviews_github.html)
* What if there are no open pull requests?
  - In that case, you may do a code review on a merged PR [see insttructions here](https://ucsb-cs156.github.io/topics/code_reviews/reviewing_a_merged_PR.html), even though that's a bit artificial.

* Once you've done the code review, complete and submit [h02](https://ucsb-cs156.github.io/s24/hwk/h02). This should just be a link to a code review that you performed for another team member on team01.
* If you are ready to submit on Canvas, submit then start [team02](https://ucsb-cs156.github.io/w24/lab/team02.html) (the repos, starter code, kanban boards, etc. will be in place by 6pm).   Teams that have submitted on Canvas can get started.
* If not done with team01:
  - Work as a team on finishing team01 with the goal of submitting before midnight.
  - Consider planning ahead for some time outside of class to work on team02 so you can get caught up.

Note: if anyone on your team that has unfinished work on team01 is a no-show today (in the sense that they are not in contact with the team at all, and so the team is blocked), please contact the instructor immediately.

# Getting started on team02

For team02, there are six database tables that you'll be working on, one per team member.  Please divide these up in your slack channel:
* Articles: for example, blog posts, newspaper articles, etc.
* UCSB Dining Commons Menu Items: food/beverage items offered by UCSB Dining Halls
* Menu Item Reviews: reviews of food/beverage items offered by UCSB Dining Halls
* Help Requests: requests for help, e.g. those on the #help-lecture-discussion channel of the course slack
* Recommendation Requests: e.g. requests for letters of rec for grad school, scholarships, jobs
* UCSB Organizations: student orgs at UCSB

I suggest that you do this on your team slack channel in a single post, and then "pin" that post to your channel.

That post might look something like this:

```
Adam:  Articles
Brianna: Menu Item Reviews
Chris:  Help Requests
Danny: Recommendation Requests
Erin: UCSB Organizations
Fay: UCSB Dining Commons Menu Items
```

# Looking ahead to Wednesday:

On Wednesday, whether you are finished or not with team01,  your team needs to do the initial assignment of topics for team02 (it breaks up into six separate subprojects, just like team01 did), and the initial set up tasks on the team's Kanban board.

On Wednesday, ONLY once you've done that, you may ask for help with team01.

(TAs/LAs: On Wednesday, if anyone asks for help with team01, help them but only after they show you that they've claimed a database table for team02, and have assigned themselves at least one issue for that table in the In Progress column.")

# Looking ahead to Thursday

The first 45 minutes of class will be devoted to a different team activity, the one that I consider to be the most important part of the Agile software process: Retrospectives.    Please do be on time for class Thursday, and plan to give your full attention to that activity for the first 45 minutes.   After that, it will be a help session on team02.


And, to prepare for Thursday, please read this article:

* [Agile Retros](https://ucsb-cs156.github.io/topics/agile/agile_retros.html)

# CATME evaluation

Also: you will be getting a email reminders to complete a CATME survey at <https://catme.org> which is the first of several "peer evaluations".  This is an opportunity to reflect on how things are going in your team.    

Completing this survey by midnight Wednesday counts as a homework grade.   If I have to extend the deadline past 11:59 Wednesday for anyone, it will result in a significant penalty, so please just do it today.  Why not right now?
