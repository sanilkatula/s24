This homework assignment is intended to be done sometime during the period that the
team is working on team01.

For precise deadline info, see: <{{page.canvas_assignment_link}}>

Your task is to perform at least one "code review" on a "pull request" for your team.

You can find the list of available PRs to review at the links below.  Only PRs that have a green check should be reviewed

A code review can have three possible outcomes:
* Approve, along with a comment such as "Looks Good To Me" or LGTM for short.
* Approve, along with some specific comment of praise for good code, suggestions for improvement, and/or questions about parts of the code (which, given that it's an "approve", might or might not be seen and responded to by the code author)
* Request Changes.  In this case, there should be some specific questions or suggestions that the code author must respond to in some way.  A second round of code review is then done.

To get credit for this assignment, any of these is acceptable.  In a future assignment, I may require some specific comments on the code.  You are encouraged to
practice that in this round, even though it's not a requirement of the assignment.

# How to do a code review

There is a specific set of steps that need to be taken in a code review; you can read more about that at this link:

* <https://ucsb-cs156.github.io/topics/code_reviews/code_reviews_github.html>

There is also an article about what kinds of things to look for in a Code Review:

# Submitting on Canvas

To submit on Canvas, submit a link to the pull request.  That will be something like this:
* <https://github.com/ucsb-cs156-w24/team01-s24-5pm-1/pull/20>

If you did it correctly, somewhere on that page should be something like this.

<img width="951" alt="image" src="https://github.com/ucsb-cs156/f23/assets/1119017/1dc19036-0f8c-4bd8-af0a-6ba93dcc260f">

* It's important that it not *only* be the text <img width="218" alt="image" src="https://github.com/ucsb-cs156/f23/assets/1119017/448d6d57-85ff-4c7c-9cee-bc1c8f21fef9">
* To be a proper approving code review, it *must* have this part: <img width="939" alt="image" src="https://github.com/ucsb-cs156/f23/assets/1119017/8d7ceb39-6574-437b-9ea9-e1990967a7d4">
* If you don't have that text, see this article on how to do it properly: <https://ucsb-cs156.github.io/topics/code_reviews/code_reviews_github.html>

Then **submit here on Canvas**: <{{page.canvas_assignment_link}}>

# Frequently Asked Questions:

* Q: We have to do one.  Can we do more than one?
* A: It's ok to do more than one, but each team member should do at least one.

* Q: Can we review a PR that someone else already reviewed?
* A: It's ok if more than one team member reviews the same PR; though it would be better to spread out the effort.

* Q: Can we review a PR that was already merged?
* A: It's definitely not ideal, because it doesn't help move the team forward; at that point.  But sure, I'll accept it for sake of making it easier to "complete the assignment". I recognize that sometimes when folks are working at different speeds, asynchronously, compromises have to be made.  But the bigger picture is that we want everyone on the team to be sharing the responsibility of getting PRs reviewed and merged.
