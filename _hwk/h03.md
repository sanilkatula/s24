This homework grade is to complete your CATME peer evaluation by midnight Wednesday April 24.  

If you complete it, *including writing actual thoughtful comments about the work of each of your peers* you'll get a grade of 100/100.

Please look at the kanban board and consider your teammates contributions to all
team activities to date, including team01, but also all of the other team activities throughout the course.  By now, you should have had enough interactions
to have some idea about their level of contributions, what their strengths are,
and possibly areas where they can improve.

If you complete it, but your comments are something generic that is copy and pasted 5 times like:

```
Alice is doing a great job!
Bob is doing a great job!
Charlene is doing a great job!
David is doing a great job!
Erica is doing a great job!
```

Then your grade will be at most 80/100 (i.e. a 20 point deduction for "phoning it in".)

Grades between 80 and 100 are at the instructors discretion based on the degree to which your feedback shows thoughtful consideration.

If you complete the survey after midnight Wednesday April 24, but before 4pm on Thursday April 25, you will receive a grade of at most 60/100 (i.e. a 40 point deduction for having to be reminded to complete it beyond the automatic emails and reminders in class.)

If you fail to complete it before 4pm on Thursday April 24th, the grade will be
0/100 and cannot be made up.
