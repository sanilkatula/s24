To get credit for this activity, you need to join the course GitHub organization.  Instructions appear here:

* <{{page.canvas_url}}>
  
It will then be due {{page.due |  date: '%B %d, %Y at %l:%M %p' }}.

Students completing it after the due date/time will still get credit, since all students must complete this to be assigned to a team, but the credit will be reduced by 50%.

The grade will not automatically update in Canvas when you complete this;
the course staff have to do a manual process to update this grade.
It will be done periodically up to the deadline, and then once after the deadline has passed.
