# Homework {{page.title}}

This homework assignment requires you to have completed up through step 2.7 in team01: creating a *personal* deployment on Dokku for team01.

- To do this, you should follow the steps under [Step 2.7 of team01](https://ucsb-cs156.github.io/s24/lab/team01.html#step-27-deploy-your-branch-to-a-dev-deployment).
- Note that you can do this even if you haven't finished steps 2.3, 2.4, 2.5 and 2.6 yet; all you need is a branch other than main, which you now have
  if you completed step 2.2a.

Once you are done with this step, submit a link to your running Dokku instance on Canvas as the submission for {{page.title}}.

For example: `http://team01-cgaucho-dev.dokku-13.cs.ucsb.edu`

# Then: continue working on team01

The goal should be to have *at least the service and it's tests* completed before the next lecture ({{page.next_lecture}}), so that everyone in class can do at least one "code review" during the next class.

If you can have both the service and controller done before class that day, that's even better.

It's good to aim for a pace a bit faster than the deadlines so that there's time to get help in case something goes wrong.
