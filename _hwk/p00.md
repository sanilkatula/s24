To get credit for this activity, you need to fill out the CATME team formation survey.

Students were notified of this assignment starting in week 10 of the prior quarter with periodic email reminders, though strictly speaking, the assignment cannot be officially given until the quarter starts, which happens {{page.assigned |  date: '%B %d, %Y at %l:%M %p' }}.

It will then be due {{page.due |  date: '%B %d, %Y at %l:%M %p' }}.

Students completing it after the due date/time will still get credit, since all students must complete this to be assigned to a team, but the credit will be reduced by 50%.
