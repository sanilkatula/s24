This assignment is completed on gradescope and will be released {{page.assigned |  date: '%B %d, %Y at %l:%M %p' }}.

It is very straightforward, but very important. There are several things that staff needs to do to set up things for the course, we cannot do these things until EVERYONE completes P00. (or, we could, but then some folks accounts just wont work... and that will suck)

Due: {{page.due |  date: '%B %d, %Y at %l:%M %p' }}, meaning if you don't do it before section, you'll be doing it during section.
