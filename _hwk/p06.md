Today in section, to get credit for the participation assignment, you
need to:
* *be finished with* jpa00
* *at least* submit the starter code for jpa01

You don't actually need to submit anything on Canvas for this; we'll just check Gradescope to see if you've at least gotten to this point.

If you've already completed this, we want to encourage you to start jpa02, and if it's been released, jpa03:

* <https://ucsb-cs156.github.io/s24/lab/jpa02.html>
* <https://ucsb-cs156.github.io/s24/lab/jpa03.html>

Both of these are *really straightforward* and involve minimal coding.  They are more about learning the logistics of working with the general setup of web applications in Java on the dokku servers at UCSB.

So if you follow the instructions carefully, you'll be done with them very quickly.  But it's a really good idea to start on them *in class* on Wednesday and try to finish before class on Thursday so that if you need help, you can get it from your teammates and from the instructor, TAs, and LAs.

The goal is to be done with all of jpa01, jpa02 and jpa03 by next Tuesday
so that we are ready to start our first team project.
